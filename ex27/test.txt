Season 6
of The Big Bang Theory has been marked by slowly brewing tension among the various characters. Leonard and Penny have hit another plateau in their relationship, with Leonard ready to settle down but Penny being her usual waffle-y self. meanwhile, Sheldon has spent the bulk of the season treating Amy like less of a partner and more of a pack mule, a role which until now she's been content to play. But all the tension finally bubbled to the surface this week as these two relationships hit major bumps. And it's all that damned Harry Potter's fault.

As egocentric as Sheldon has been lately, there was bound to be something that set Leonard off one of these days. I suppose an argument over Harry Potter spoilers is as valid as anything else. And certainly, anyone who struggled to power-read the final couple of books before spoilers hit the grapevine can sympathize. It was an amusing way to kick off what was a relatively dark episode by Big Bang standards. However, I t
hought the writers were a little cruel when they mirrored the conflict at the end by having Sheldon spoil a major character death in The Walking Dead. Harry Potter spoilers are fair game at this point. The final book is well over five years old and the movie adaptations have come and gone. But to spoil a major development in a TV season that isn't even finished yet, much less available on DVD, is just cruel and thoughtless on the part of the writers.
